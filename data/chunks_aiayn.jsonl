{"text": "## Section: Introduction\n\nRecurrent neural networks, long short-term memory and gated recurrent neural networks in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation . Numerous efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder architectures . Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states ```h_t```, as a function of the previous hidden state ```h_{t-1}``` and the input for position ```t```. This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks and conditional computation , while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains. Attention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduction models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in the input or output sequences . In all but a few cases , however, such attention mechanisms are used in conjunction with a recurrent network. In this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs. %After the seminal papers of , , and , recurrent models have become the dominant solution for both sequence modeling and sequence-to-sequence transduction. Many efforts such as have pushed the boundaries of machine translation and language modeling with recurrent sequence models. Recent effort has combined the power of conditional computation with sequence models to train very large models for machine translation, pushing SOTA at lower computational cost. Recurrent models compute a vector of hidden states ```h_t```, for each time step ```t``` of computation. ```h_t``` is a function of both the input at time ```t``` and the previous hidden state ```h_t```. This dependence on the previous hidden state encumbers recurrnet models to process multiple inputs at once, and their time complexity is a linear function of the length of the input and output, both during training and inference. [What I want to say here is that although this is fine during decoding, at training time, we are given both input and output and this linear nature does not allow the RNN to process all inputs and outputs simultaneously and haven't been used on datasets that are the of the scale of the web. What's the largest dataset we have ? . Talk about Nividia and possibly other's effors to speed up things, and possibly other efforts that alleviate this, but are still limited by it's comptuational nature]. Rest of the intro: What if you could construct the state based on the actual inputs and outputs, then you could construct them all at once. This has been the foundation of many promising recent efforts, bytenet,facenet (Also talk about quasi rnn here). Now we talk about attention!! Along with cell architectures such as long short-term meory (LSTM) , and gated recurrent units (GRUs) , attention has emerged as an essential ingredient in successful sequence models, in particular for machine translation. In recent years, many, if not all, state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in machine translation have been achieved with attention-based sequence models . Talk about the neon work on how it played with attention to do self attention! Then talk about what we do.", "metadata": {"section": "Introduction", "subsection": null, "subsubsection": null, "contains_math": 1, "paper_title": "Attention Is All You Need", "authors": ["Ashish Vaswani", "Noam Shazeer", "Niki Parmar", "Jakob Uszkoreit", "Llion Jones", "Aidan N.

{"text": "## Section: Background\n\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU , ByteNet and ConvS2S , all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models, the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions . In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section~. Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations . End-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-aligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks . To the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-aligned RNNs or convolution.

While for small values of ```d_k``` the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms dot product attention without scaling for larger values of ```d_k``` .

The third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies .

In Table~ rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions, keeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section . While single-head attention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads. In Table~ rows (B), we observe that reducing the attention key size ```d_k``` hurts model quality. This suggests that determining compatibility is not easy and that a more sophisticated compatibility function than dot product may be beneficial. We further observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected, bigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-fitting. In row (E) we replace our sinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings , and observe nearly identical results to the base model.", "metadata": {"section": "Results", "subsection": "Model Variations", "subsubsection": null, "contains_math": 1, "paper_title": "Attention Is All You Need", "authors": ["Ashish Vaswani", "Noam Shazeer", "Niki Parmar", "Jakob Uszkoreit", "Llion Jones", "Aidan N.

This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural constraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence models have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes . We trained a 4-layer transformer with ```d_{model} = 1024``` on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the Penn Treebank , about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting, using the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences . We used a vocabulary of 16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokens for the semi-supervised setting. We performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout, both attention and residual (section~), learning rates and beam size on the Section 22 development set, all other parameters remained unchanged from the English-to-German base translation model. During inference, we increased the maximum output length to input length + ```300```. We used a beam size of ```21``` and ```\\alpha=0.3``` for both WSJ only and the semi-supervised setting. Our results in Table~ show that despite the lack of task-specific tuning our model performs surprisingly well, yielding better results than all previously reported models with the exception of the Recurrent Neural Network Grammar .

{"text": "## Section: Conclusion\n\nIn this work, we presented the Transformer, the first sequence transduction model based entirely on attention, replacing the recurrent layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures with multi-headed self-attention.\nFor translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures based on recurrent or convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014 English-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best model outperforms even all previously reported ensembles. %We also provide an indication of the broader applicability of our models through experiments on English constituency parsing.\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We plan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and to investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs such as images, audio and video.\nMaking generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at htps://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor.", "metadata": {"section": "Conclusion", "subsection": null, "subsubsection": null, "contains_math": 0, "paper_title": "Attention Is All You Need", "authors": ["Ashish Vaswani", "Noam Shazeer", "Niki Parmar", "Jakob Uszkoreit", "Llion Jones", "Aidan N.
